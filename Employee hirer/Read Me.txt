This program checks if the a person with his major can be hired or not. The number of vacancies are also considered. If the person's major is needed, persons information adds to a text file named [employees_information]. The order of adding is that the information adds under the title of the job. For instance, when a person applies for Marketing Specialist, his or her information adds under the Marketing Specialist title. The text file is human readable. The other text file called [vacancies] has all the vacancies in a particular job. If there is no vacancies, information would not be added to the [employees_information] text file. The inputs should be exactly the same as the dictionary keys in the top of the program.(lower and upper cases arealso considered.) If you wish to change the data, make sure to change them on both dictionary and vacancy text files.
